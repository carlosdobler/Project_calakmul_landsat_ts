# Project: Analysis of Landsat time series (Calakmul, Mexico)

This project represents a sequential procedure to pre-process and analyze a dense stack of Landsat imagery (1985-2018) in order to assess land cover change in Calakmul, Mexico on a per-pixel basis. In essense, the procedure involves the generation of "chips" to visually classify land-cover changes in a number of training points. Subsequently, it segments per-pixel time-series of NDMI to then calculate univariate statistics of each segement. Next, a Random Forest model is fit to classify time-series segments based on training data. The RF model is then used to classify all segments in all pixels of the scene. Lastly, it estimates the duration in which a given pixel remained as either forest cover or non-forest cover, to then quantify the extent of these two cover categories at different point in time. This procedure is divided in eight sequential scripts. Script no. 4 "Classify scene" was written to be run on a Google Cloud Computing environment.
